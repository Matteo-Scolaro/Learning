      <strong>Welcome to GS!</strong>
      <p>
        In our GS group in Toronto, we meet every Sunday to understand what we are living. To see what GS truly is, read the <em>What is GS?</em> to the right of this text.

        What do I do if I want to attend, but I'm too old or too young?

        In the case of age, you do not have to worry. You can check the link on top of the page to view the CL Canada site, CL being the version of GS for adults. If you are in University, we have CLU, which stands for Communion and Liberation University.
        If you would like to, you can certaintly join that group. If, on the other hand, you are in middle school (grades 5-8) you can join the Grande Ecole. And if you are even younger, we always have the Petite Ecole.

      <em>What is GS?</em>
      <p>
        GS is a youth group, founded by Luigi Giussani, in which we read different books that he wrote. GS is short for Giovanile Studentesca, it's Italian meaning the group of young students, it is especailly for High School students.
        In the group we talk about our lives, and what is affecting them in what ways. We do this throught Giussani's books.
